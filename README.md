rally-release-based-sprint-burndown
===================================

A burndown that can be filtered by release-associated items.  The chart displays a burndown of items
that are associated with a particular release, an ideal line, and the deviation from that ideal.


This burndown uses the analytics 2.0 API and so is not available for on-premise users.

The app's show_team boolean can be set to have the chart display either aggregated or broken down by team (with hours 
normalized to a percentage of the first day's choice)
